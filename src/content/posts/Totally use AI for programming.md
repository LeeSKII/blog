## Introduction

This post record how to use ai for programming.

openai-apis, claude-3.5-sonnet, gtp-4o.

## Thinking

AI has been used for programming for a long time and shows great power.

But for other fields, it is still in its infancy.

I notice that the key to achieve success in other fields is data.

The success of AI in programming is not only about the architecture of the model, but also about the quality of the data. 

There are must have a lots of hight quality data for AI use to train the model.
